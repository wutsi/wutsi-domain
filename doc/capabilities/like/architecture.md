# Like Widget
The Like widget is a javascript widget that can be embeded in any website to display the like badge.
The snipped of code would like like:

```
<span data-wutsi-component='like' data-url='https://www.foo.com'></span>
<script type='text/javascript' src='https://www.wutsi.com/widgets/like.js' />
```
